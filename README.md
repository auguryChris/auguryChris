### Hi there 👋 

I'm Chris, a data scientist and human-centered design strategist: a data hacker, analyst, designer and communicator with over a decade of work and leadership experience. Having recently pivoted from design and product direction to data science, I am committed to helping businesses drive strategic decision making and impact through data management and analysis.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with organizational psychologist and management consultants to turn psychometrics into data products.
